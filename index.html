      <p>Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and easy. You go to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download 
          and download Visual Studio.exe as per your version. Then install the app, after that you can launch it and work in it by adding files.

        The console is an operating system window where we can check our code outputs. 
        It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode.
        To open the console, you can right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect Element", and the developer window will appear.

        console.log("My First Console App");

          var first_name = "Ranbir";
          var last_name = "Kapoor";
          var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
          console.log(full_name);

          var a = 21;
          var b = 7;

          var add = a+b;
          console.log(add);

          var subtract = a-b;
          console.log(subtract);

          var multiply = a*b;
          console.log(multiply);

          var divide = a/b;
          console.log(divide);
